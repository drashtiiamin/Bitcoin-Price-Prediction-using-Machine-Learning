# Bitcoin Price Prediction using Machine Learning with Oracle Cloud ERP

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using machine learning algorithms and integrate the model into Oracle Cloud ERP for real-time predictions.

### Tools & Technologies:
- Python
- Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, LSTM)
- Oracle Cloud ERP
- pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, keras
- GitHub for version control

### Dataset:
- Bitcoin historical price data (Open, Close, High, Low, Volume)

### Model Development:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- LSTM (Deep Learning)

### Oracle Cloud Integration:
- Cloud storage of the trained model
- Data fetching and prediction capabilities

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the scripts to preprocess data, train models, and deploy them to Oracle Cloud.
